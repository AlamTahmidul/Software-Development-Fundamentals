[x] New List Creation - the user interface has a button for adding a new list, but it doesn't work. Correct this. Note that when a list is created it should immediately switch to edit mode for that list.
[x] Item Editing - the user should be able to change the text for each item. Note this should be undoable/redoable.
[x] List Deletion - the list has a button for deleting each list, but it doesn't work. Correct this. Make sure list deletion works as it did in HW 2 with a modal that asks for verification before actually deleting the list. Such a modal must provide Confirm/Cancel options to the user.
[x] List Saving - remember that after every single edit, data should be saved to the database.
[x] Foolproof Design - make sure the undo, redo, and close buttons are only enabled when they are usable. When disabled, they should look faded (use transparency) and should not be clickable.
[x] More Foolproof Design - also make sure that when we are editing either a list name or text in an item that we cannot interact with any other controls. They should look disabled and be disabled.
[x] Version Control - make sure you use Git for the full duration of the project. Make commits at least for each completed task. You should be ready to show the TA a commit for each task you wish to receive points for.
